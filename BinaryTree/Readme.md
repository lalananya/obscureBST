**Binary Tree**

**BTree**

   Targets large amount of data, large number of keys stored in a single node
   search  insert delete = o(logn)

   order of the tree  = maximum number of children a node can have

   Let's say order = 5

   property 1 : 2*5 - 1 = 9 (every node can store 9 keys)
   property 2 : number of children of a node is equal to number of keys in it plus 1
   property 3 : All keys of the node sorted in increasing order
   property 4 : insertion happends only at leaf of a Btree**


**Trie**
