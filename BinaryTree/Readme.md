**Binary Tree**

**BTree**

   = m-way tree
   = order m b-tree can have m-1 keys and m children
   = capability to store large number of keys in a single node, and large key values , thus keeping height short
   
   Properties of BTree, that must follows
   1. every node is btree contains at most m children
   2. every node in a btree, except root and leaf node contains atleast m/2 (minimum) children
   3. root must have atleast 2 nodes (minimum)
   4. all leaf nodes must be at the same level

   Insertion : 
   done at leaf node.
